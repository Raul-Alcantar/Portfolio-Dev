    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>As a UX/UI & product designer, I’ve been expanding my skills beyond design principles to understand how interfaces actually come to life through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learning front-end development has helped me bridge the gap between design and implementation, improving how I communicate with developers and how I think about interaction, responsiveness, and accessibility. My approach remains rooted in clarity, empathy, and purpose, but now with a deeper understanding of the technical side of digital products. I enjoy exploring how thoughtful design and clean code can work together to create seamless, human-centered experiences that are both intuitive and functional.</p>
    <p>Whether designing, prototyping, or experimenting with front-end code, I’m driven by curiosity and the goal of becoming a more versatile designer, one capable of crafting solutions that not only look great, but also work beautifully in the browser.</p>

        <h3>About This Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I designed and built both this portfolio and the website itself to reflect my journey as a self taught front-end developer and UX/UI & product designer, combining creativity with code. I’ve built it to apply and showcase the skills I gained through hands-on practice and the Frontend Masters Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bootcamp. Through these projects, I’ve learned to create well structured layouts, interactive interfaces, and clean, maintainable code, translating design ideas into functional web experiences. I enjoy experimenting with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript behavior to make interfaces dynamic and user-friendly.</p> <p>This portfolio is a showcase of my commitment to continuous learning and growth in web development. Every project here reflects not just my design sense, but also my technical ability to build real, working websites from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Design Projects</h3>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked on around 15 design projects across various industries and platforms, including redesigning digital products into web and mobile applications and developing e-commerce solutions for wholesale and international retail markets.</p>
        <p>My clients include banking, international feminist movements, music platforms, and business tools. While my main focus is UX/UI & product design, I have also contributed to branding and landing page projects, which have expanded my perspective on creating cohesive digital experiences. Below, I present one detailed case study and two additional design projects that showcase my problem-solving skills and user-centered approach.</p>

            <h4>Case Study: MFM</h4>
            <p>This platform is a digital experience for a feminist training center that educates, connects, and supports activists, organizations, and public officials. The platform strengthens social leadership, promotes civic engagement, and creates learning and networking spaces to advance gender equality and social justice.

            <p>Bold Bites is a meat products sales platform that underwent a full redesign for both web and mobile. I was involved throughout the process, from early benchmarking and user flow analysis to UI design and brand definition, ensuring visual consistency and usability across all touchpoints.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I like to stay active and challenge myself, whether it's lifting weights, practicing calisthenics, or learning something new. I'm also passionate about music and enjoy picking up new instruments whenever I can!! I love exploring new languages and expanding my skills through practice. When I need a break, I dive into video games like Super Smash Bros. and Call of Duty, or relax by watching movies with my family. These hobbies keep me curious, disciplined, and balanced, giving me inspiration and energy that I bring back into my work as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Guitar</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is music. I’m sharing this video where I created a live loop cover of one of my favorite Daft Punk songs, <em>Something About Us.</em> I recorded it a few years ago, and I thought it would be fun to share it so you can watch and enjoy it. Hope you like it!

    <h3>Piano</h3>
    <p>A few years ago, I recorded myself playing Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy on the keyboard. It’s one of those pieces that makes me lose track of time. I spent 40 days learning it from start to finish, since it was a very advanced piece for my level. Playing it taught me a lot about discipline and patience and I thought it would be a fun opportunity to experiment with embedding videos using HTML and CSS. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p>One of the things I really enjoy is photography. I like capturing small moments, playing with light, and seeing the world from different angles. It’s a way for me to relax, experiment, and notice things I might otherwise miss. Below, I’m sharing a selection of my photos, hope they give you a glimpse of what I see through my lens.</p>
